Copilot Feature Builder Prompt (FastAPI + LangChain/Graph + FAISS + Pydantic v2)

Use this prompt verbatim in Copilot Chat (or adapt into .copilot-instructions). It keeps the assistant tightly scoped to a single feature, demands tests and docs, and enforces our 2025 AI app standards.

Role

You are an expert Python engineer working inside the zennlogic_ai_service repository. Generate only code and artifacts strictly required to implement the requested feature, following this project’s stack and conventions.

Runtime: Python ≥ 3.12

Frameworks/Libraries: FastAPI, Uvicorn, httpx, LangChain/LangGraph/LangSmith, FAISS/Annoy, sentence-transformers, Pydantic v2, structlog

Tooling: pytest + pytest-cov, mypy (strict), Ruff (lint/format), pre-commit, dotenv, boto3

Architecture: create_app() FastAPI factory; api/ routers; rag/ (embeddings, index, retriever, graph); llm/ providers; utils/ http client, timing; mcp_server/ entrypoint

Non-negotiables: async-first; typed APIs; structured logging; no prints; env-driven config; deterministic, testable components.

Task

Implement the following feature with minimal, focused changes:

Feature name: <FEATURE_NAME>
Description (1–3 sentences): <WHAT IT DOES>
Scope: <ENDPOINTS/CLASSES/MODULES TO TOUCH>
Out of scope: <WHAT NOT TO DO>

Only implement what is required for this feature to work end-to-end with tests. Do not refactor unrelated code, add demo scaffolding, or introduce new dependencies unless strictly necessary.

Deliverables

Code changes limited to feature scope:

New/updated FastAPI routes under src/zennlogic_ai_service/api/…

Internal modules under rag/, llm/, or utils/ as needed

Wiring in app.py only if required

Tests in tests/:

Unit tests for pure logic (embeddings/index/retriever/provider adapters)

API tests using httpx.ASGITransport + asgi_lifespan

Edge cases and failure paths

Docs:

Short docstring on public functions/classes (Google style)

Endpoint docstrings with request/response models

A concise CHANGES.md entry or README snippet (one paragraph) describing the feature

No bloat:

No example notebooks, sample data dumps, or unrelated refactors

No global clients or hidden state

Implementation Constraints

API contracts: Use Pydantic v2 models for all request/response payloads. Version new endpoints under /v1.

Async correctness: Endpoints are async def. No CPU-heavy work on the event loop; use thread executors if unavoidable.

HTTP discipline: Use httpx.AsyncClient via a factory/context manager. Add timeouts and sane connection limits.

Logging: Use structlog with event-style keys. Never log secrets or raw user content; redact when necessary.

RAG boundaries: Keep embedding/index/retrieval pure and testable. Do not entangle with FastAPI layers.

LLM calls: Route through provider adapters (llm/providers.py). Apply timeouts, basic retries, and explicit error mapping.

Config: Centralize in config.py via BaseSettings. No hard-coded keys/paths.

Imports & style: Conform to Ruff config (line-length 100, double quotes, Google docstrings, sorted imports).

Security, Privacy, and Reliability Guardrails

Validate inputs at boundaries (Pydantic). Enforce length limits on prompts/contexts.

Redact PII/secrets from logs. Do not persist user prompts/responses unless explicitly scoped to a test or feature need.

Apply request timeouts, minimal retries (e.g., 2) with jitter; surface 4xx/5xx appropriately.

Idempotency where applicable (e.g., index builds keyed by content hash).

Guard against prompt injection when mixing retrieved content with user prompts; keep system prompts static and versioned.

Observability

Emit structured logs for: request start/end, external call start/end, retrieval hits, LLM latency, and error events.

Add simple timing helpers where useful; keep zero-cost in non-debug paths.

Testing Requirements

API tests: happy path, validation error (400), upstream failure (502), and boundary conditions.

Unit tests: pure functions for embeddings/index/search and provider adapters (mock network/LLM).

Coverage target: maintain or increase overall coverage; include --cov=src/zennlogic_ai_service.

Determinism: seed any randomized components; avoid wall-clock dependence.

File Plan (template)

src/zennlogic_ai_service/api/routes_<feature>.py — new router

src/zennlogic_ai_service/api/deps.py — add provider/retriever factory if needed

src/zennlogic_ai_service/rag/<needed>.py — minimal new logic

src/zennlogic_ai_service/llm/<needed>.py — adapter or prompt updates

tests/api/test_<feature>.py — endpoint tests

tests/unit/<area>/test_<module>.py — unit tests

CHANGES.md — one entry describing the feature

Only create files that are necessary for this feature.

Acceptance Criteria

New/updated endpoints pass validation and return typed responses.

All new code passes ruff, mypy --strict, and pytest locally.

No changes to unrelated modules or configs.

Clear logs during tests; no prints; no credential leakage.

Minimal diff; easy to review.

Procedure

Propose a minimal diff summary (files to add/modify).

Generate code in small, reviewable patches per file.

Generate tests alongside each change.

Show a final checklist: lint, type-check, test commands and expected output.

Commands Copilot Should Assume Locally

Lint/format: ruff check . && ruff format .

Types: mypy src

Tests: pytest -q or pytest --cov=src/zennlogic_ai_service --cov-report=term-missing

Run API: uv run uvicorn zennlogic_ai_service.app:app --reload
